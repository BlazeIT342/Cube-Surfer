# Hyper Casual Game
## Idea
The main idea was to create a simple **Hyper Casual Game**, that will be easy to play, but interesting.
### A bit shortly about mechanics
**Player** must move forward and *pick up* **yellow cubes**, which will be *past under the **Player***. There are a lot of different **barriers** on the **Player**'s way.
If **cubes** under the **Player** *collides* with the **barriers**, they *stop moving*.
The game is **endless**, untill the Player *loses all **cubes***.

## About
It was easy to come up with main mechanics, but **code structuring** and **fixing bugs** took a long time.
To do this project I used all my skills in **code structuring**. Also I used a **Ragdoll** for the die animation.

## Final Result
